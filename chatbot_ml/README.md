## About this challenge 💪

This challenge was conducted in three cycles, during which different stages were explored to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system using Deep Learning. The goal was to create a chatbot for an influencer who provides horoscopes to her followers. 
The challenge is based on a fictional story where an influencer named Amira decides to collaborate with an AI company to create a horoscope chatbot.

## A little peek to the challenge 👀

The challenge recounts the story of Amira Rashid, a young enthusiast of astrology and ancient Babylonian practices, who decides to launch a YouTube channel called 'Madame Amira' to share her zodiac predictions in an innovative way. As her videos gain popularity, Amira becomes overwhelmed by the volume of questions and comments from her followers.

In a twist of fate, Amira crosses paths with Marco Rojo and Lizeth Díaz, entrepreneurs in generative technology, who were facing a stagnation phase in their company. Together, they conceive the creation of an Artificial Intelligence-powered ChatBot to address the astrological inquiries of Madame Amira's followers.

The project is meticulously developed, with a highlight on the use of advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence and TensorFlow to train the ChatBot. Amira decides to temporarily halt video uploads to fully focus on the project's development.

Ultimately, Madame Amira's website with the ChatBot is innovatively launched in a park in Mexico City, creating a unique experience for her followers and marking a milestone in the evolution of zodiacal astrology.
