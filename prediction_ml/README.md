## About this challenge üí™

This challenge was carried out in 3 cycles, during which different stages were explored to develop a Machine Learning system capable of predicting the quantity of units needed to meet the demand for bicycles in various cities in South Korea. 
This challenge is based on the real-life case of BikePro in Seoul, South Korea.

## A little peek to the challenge üëÄ

The challenge addresses the complexity of tackling mobility in South Korea, especially in its major cities, due to the high population concentration. In 2015, the Ministry of Mobility in South Korea initiated various initiatives to enhance transportation infrastructure in the major cities, aiming for both environmental sustainability and maximizing investments.

As part of this effort, Minister Soo Yeon launched the BikePro System in Seoul in 2017. This system allows citizens to register online to rent bicycles, enabling them to pick up a bicycle from any station around the city and return it to the nearest station to their destination, for trips lasting up to a couple of hours. BikePro received a positive response for its flexible and economical rental schemes, well-located stations, and 24/7 operation, except under exceptional circumstances.

After a successful evaluation in 2018, Minister Soo Yeon planned to expand BikePro to cities like Busan, Incheon, and Daegu. This involved careful planning, including identifying key points for station placement, expanding server capacity, and designing a mobile app for registration and bike rental.

To make accurate bike procurement decisions for expansion, they needed to predict demand. Minister Soo Yeon sought assistance from Kwon Min, Minister of Data Analytics, who proposed developing a Machine Learning (ML) predictive system to anticipate bike demand by day and hour, preventing shortages or excess inventory.

Woo Young, an analyst with expertise in statistics, machine learning, and Python scripting, was chosen to lead this task. She developed algorithms and prediction models using ML, focusing on time series analysis. She considered factors like weather, holidays, and peak times, leading to the creation of a prototype.

Despite time constraints, Woo Young successfully completed the prototype, impressing Minister Kwon Min. The ML model was implemented and tested, leading to its successful deployment in the BikePro project. The predictive system proved valuable, enabling the optimization of bike inventory for an improved user experience.
