## About this challenge 💪

This challenge was developed in 3 cycles, during which the use of LLM-type chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, DallE, among other chatbots, was developed.
The objective of this challenge was to use Generative AI models for the development of a marketing plan for a fictional baseball team, learning and applying best practices, discovering the world of prompting engineering, and other details.
The challenge discusses the Montana team "The Montana Bears", which, having won the last championship, are considering the use of LLM models for brand development purposes.

## A little peek to the challenge 👀

During the thrilling finale of a baseball game, the stadium is charged with excitement as the Montana Bears are on the verge of winning the championship, an achievement they haven't reached in years. Lorraine Fox and her father, Mr. Douglas, are passionate fans of the team. Lorraine has the special task of narrating each play to her father, as he lost his vision in military service.

After the game, at the digital media agency SmartMedia where Lorraine works as Director of Advanced Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), a new project arises: a marketing campaign for the Montana Bears. This project represents a unique opportunity for Lorraine not only because of her affinity for the team but also because of the technical challenge it presents.

Lorraine and her colleague Luigi must address how to optimally use generative AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLM), in creating content for the campaign. A key difficulty is the precision in crafting "prompts" (instructions for the model), which require fine-tuning to yield accurate and relevant results.

Aware of this issue, Lorraine shares a personal anecdote about how she narrates the games to her father to highlight the importance of accuracy and detail. This inspires the team to design a detailed seven-step strategy for the marketing campaign, covering everything from defining the brand identity, creating generative content, and promoting merchandise.

The proposal turns out to be a success. It not only achieves a balance between the traditional and modern visions of the team's stakeholders but also demonstrates SmartMedia's capability to use AI in marketing campaigns. As a bonus, Mr. Douglas receives tickets for the upcoming season, allowing him to continue enjoying the games of his beloved team.
